# Commit Daily 🚀

> A mobile-first discipline & money tracking system  
> focused on **consistency, awareness, and insight-driven behavior**

## ✨ What is Commit Daily?

**Commit Daily** helps users:
- Build discipline through daily goals
- Track expenses without friction
- Understand behavior via backend-generated insights

This is not a CRUD app.  
The backend **analyzes patterns**, the frontend only visualizes them.
